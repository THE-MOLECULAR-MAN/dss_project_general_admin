  "description": "This data processing flow is designed to manage and analyze information about code environments and their usage. It begins with a dataset that contains detailed information about various code environments, including their names, programming languages, deployment modes, owners, and disk usage.\n\nThe flow processes this data to produce a summary dataset that provides insights into the disk usage statistics of these environments. Specifically, it aggregates the data by programming language to calculate the average, sum, minimum, and maximum disk sizes used by environments for each language. This summary dataset, named \"Code_Env_Summary,\" offers a concise view of how disk resources are utilized across different programming languages, helping to identify trends or inefficiencies in resource allocation.\n\nIn addition to the code environment data, the flow also includes several other datasets that provide context and additional information about the broader system. These datasets cover clusters, users, project recipes, applications, projects, plugins, and connections. Each dataset contains specific details relevant to its domain, such as cluster configurations, user profiles, project details, and plugin usage.\n\nOverall, this flow is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the code environments and their resource usage, while also integrating with other datasets to offer a holistic view of the system\u0027s operations and configurations. This can be particularly useful for administrators and developers who need to manage resources efficiently and understand the broader context of their coding environments.",
